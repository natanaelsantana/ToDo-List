It's a simple To-Do List, i made this as a exercise from The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu
this was just a EJS and Node.js introduction and i want I will be back to make more improvements in this project.
In this project I learned a new concept, like export function and make templates and layout using EJS. 
I also learned how to deploy my projects with a server side using mongoDB Atlas!
Now it's possible to create custom lists just typing in the route

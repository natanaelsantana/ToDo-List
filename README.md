It's a simple To-Do List, i made this as a exercise from The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu
this was just a EJS and Node.js introduction and i want I will be back to make more improvements in this project.
In this project I learned a new concept, like export function and make templates and layout using EJS. 
Now it's possible to create custom lists just typing in the route


## **Installation Instructions**

This repo uses Node.js, and I leave to you de packages and i already initalized npm for you! So you just have to install with this command line in your terminal (of course you have to "cd" in the local you saved the files :)  )
```
npm install
```

The project will run with: 
```
node app.js
```

To make this function in your pc, you need mongoDB and need to initilize a server 

It will automatically initialize in "localhost:3000" just type this in your browser
